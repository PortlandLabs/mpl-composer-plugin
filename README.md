## FAQ
- **Q: I deleted composer.lock and my vendor directory and now I can't run composer install**
- A: `mpl/composer-plugin` use a custom repository, so it must be present for any other `mpl/` dependencies to resolve.
Try:
  - Removing any `mpl/*` `require` or `require-dev` entries other than `mpl/composer-plugin`
  - Run `composer update`
  - Add back any removed requirements.
